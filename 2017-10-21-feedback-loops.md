# MVP Everything
Building with scope minimality in mind has a few obvious benefits. Product market fit will happen faster as you are gathering feedback more often. Keeping your feature bloat low will lead to a simple product and give your "killer feature" room to shine. Bug rate will decrease because you are putting the product in the hands of users quicker and more often. (bugs are inevitable, but keeping them as squashed as possible is a win for everyone).


# Smaller Milestones, Better Estimation
It is a fact that large milestones are difficult to estimate, and estimation is a near-impossible skill to master. Missing targets and deadlines is bad for company morale and bad for optics.
If we are now thinking of each feature or task as its own MVP, then why not milestones?

Breaking milestone into minimal shippable units would increase chance of success and decrease headache. Hitting milestones and shipping features is an important team chemistry ingredient. Good team chemisty increases product quality, employee moral, and team velocity.

Last but not least, nailing your milestones looks great for stakeholders and investors!


# More collaboration and Inclusion = Better Product
Increasing the number of feedback loops gives the team more opportunities to collaborate. A [diverse](https://hbr.org/2013/12/how-diversity-can-drive-innovation), [collaborative](http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/ey-is-collaboration-the-new-innovation/$FILE/ey-is-collaboration-the-new-innovation.pdf) environment drives innovation at any size or level of a company. Utilizing the power of diverse insights will lead to a more accessable product that is user-centric in its design.

Finally, investment and a feeling ownership of a product is important to create quality output. Getting a particular user involved in product iteration from the beginning gives that user a sense of investment. The same goes for team members and stakeholders. No one ones to feel like a cog in the wheel.
