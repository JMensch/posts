I'm sorry all you all every get is my word vomit, someday i'll be more articulate

I believe a manager should, first and foremost, be an advocate and champion for her or his team. Hire well, truly care about your employees, empower them to shine, and they will. Sounds like a simple formula, right? Anyone that has been in any kind of relationship will know it isn't as simple as X + Y = Z. It'll take an entire [book](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove-ebook/dp/B015VACHOK) to talk about all the variables that contribute to a happy and productive team member, so, for the next 500 words or so, I'm going to talk about how I make my team's work visible to other employees at Threatcare (the crowd breathes a sigh of relief).

## A piece of my learning journey

If you'd like to skip my story and go right to the meat of the article, please go [here](). I'll only be slightly offended, but I'll get over it.

I felt compelled to write after, during a conversation discussing personnel and hiring, a coworker asked me what one of my team members has produced lately. My mind immediately went to a defensive place filled with unfelpful thoughts: We have weekly leadership meetings where we discuss priorities; I take the time to disseminate a (very) detailed weekly Product Team Newsletter; Why would this person waste my time asking me a question I've already provided the answer to in multiple mediums? I put aside my feelings for the moment, shifted into a learning conversation, and swiftly I understood where they were coming from and realized the problem. I was communicating what my team was working on in a way that I'm most comfortable with: bullet points filled with tasks completed. Release notes. Technical jargon. No mention of why we prioritized this task over another or how it's going to affect the other teams. I was communicating the _what_, but leaving out the _why_. I was advocating for my team, but in a language that only my team understood.

## Be persistent (and don't take it personally)

The most important takeaway here is don't take it personally if someone doesn't read an email, text, calendar description, etc. They aren't obligated to. They're probably just as busy as you, and I bet you don't. Instead, go and find out why the medium you're using isn't working. Make it easy for them. With a little bit of compromise on your part, you'll find something that works for you both.

## Translation is hard

Ever get an email from a team whose day to day you don't fully understand, full of jargon that resembles English but you'd bet on it being from some far away land? If you're not being deliberate when communicating, you probably sound just as foreign to everyone else. Communicating nuance and technical details is difficult, but if you want what you're communicating to be absorbed you need to be deliberate about it.

# Making work visible

So now we know it isn't about us. Simply communicating all the things your team has accomplished isn't enough. Let's talk about some mediums to communicate with other teams effectively.

## Newsletters

My personal favorite is a newsletter. It's asyncronous. It can be read whenever it's convenient. It's permanent. I akin it to Axios, which I read daily- Consistency, accessability, and reliability being the three main ingredients to a successful and often read periodical.

## Cross-team collaboration

In my opinion, cross-team collaboration is more effective than newsletters on the individual level, but obviously doesn't have the reach and is ephemeral. The Product Team is lucky at Threatcare because we have an awesome Sales and Services team that we can collaborate with on projects, and I try and go out of my way to include other teams and perspectives in our processes. If you don't have that, try and find a reason to include other people or teams. It'll only benefit you.

## Ownership(?)

Another process I strongly believe in is task ownership. Empower everyone on your team to own _something_. Guide them towards the correct outcome, but let them define the path. I've found that leads to collaboration that I wouldn't expect as well as more "shop talk" about the cool stuff we're working on.

# Wrap up

I'd love to hear how other leaders surface their team's work to the company. Please reach out!
